To build the passes & benchmarks, then run the benchmarks & output to console, simply go to the directory containing 

./RUN_ME.sh

and run it from a console. This script isn't smart enough to run when your working directory isn't the same as the script,
so be aware of that :(.

Or, use one of the following helper scripts instead: 

./build_and_dis_tests.sh:     Builds benchmarks and placed *.bc and *.ll (human-readable) files in this directory
./do_licm_tests.sh:           Runs lli on our the benchmark *.bc files before and after applying LICM pass 
                              (the optimized version is saved as *-opt.bc)
